# SecureFileTool 

SecureFileTool is a set of simple tools developed in Python to perform basic operations related to file security.

It enables you to:

- Generate RSA key pairs (private and public)
- Encrypt a text file using an RSA public key
- Decrypt an encrypted file (.enc) using an RSA private key
- Generate a SHA256 hash of a file
- Verify the integrity of a file by comparing its contents with a supplied SHA256 hash

##  Installation

1.  **Run the :** repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LamyaMeriem/Cybersecurity-Portfolio.git
    cd Cybersecurity-Portfolio/SecureFileTool
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then run :

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Features

The following scripts are available:

| Script | Description |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate_keys.py`| Generates a pair of RSA keys (private/public) and saves them in the `/keys/` folder. |
| Encrypt_file.py Encrypts a specified `.txt` file with the RSA public key.
| decrypt_file.py` | Decrypts a specified `.enc` file with the RSA private key. |
| `hash_tool.py` | Generates a SHA256 hash for a specified `.txt` file. |
| `check_hash.py` | Checks the integrity of a file by comparing its current hash with an existing `.hash` file.
| `utils.py` | Contains utility functions (file/key loading) used by other scripts. |
